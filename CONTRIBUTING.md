============

1.  Ensure that all tests pass (`make test`).
2.  Ensure that performance has not been affected (`make bench`).
3.  Use `make lint` to check for problems.
4.  Changes to `dist` should not be committed.  (We will regenerate
    `dist/commonmark.js` before a release.)
5.  Follow the style of the existing code.
